IN the hands of Erasmus Latin is, before all
things, a living language. His Colloqaiea not

only form a store-house of idiom‚ but they exhibit
real dramatis power. In the present selection
variety both in subject and style has been specially
aimed at. Besides the bright and playful dialogue‚
the reader will find here many passages which,
though dramatis in form, are excellent and at the
same time easy examples of the narrative and
reflective styles of Latin Prose. The original text
of Erasmus has been freely dealt with, in order to
secure greater simplicity of vocabulary and syntax;
and some of the dialogues have been considerably
shortened. It is hoped that a selection of
‘dramatis idylls‚' thus adapted, will prove a useful
and entertaining reading-book for young students.
